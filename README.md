# Quantitative-Portfolio-Generation
## Introduction

This project attempts to replicate professional quant process to generate a portfolio that is based on multiple alpha vectors and optimized under constraints of risk models

This project will:
- Use Zipline for data processing
- Construct a risk model using PCA
- Generates and evaluate different alpha factors from research papers
- Combines signals from multiple alpha for enhanced alpha
- Perform advanced portfolio optimization with CVXPY based on the combined alpha vector and the risk model
